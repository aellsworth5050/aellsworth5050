Hello - I'm new here.  Been trying to learn as much as I can about crypto, specifically the culture/cultural aspects, but looking to get deeper into the technical.  
- 
- Hoping to come across new ideas / technologies / perspective and more, and - yes - looking to hopefully [one day] explore career options in the crypto space once I'm able to prove my worth.
- Just looking to learn, learn, learn at the moment, and welcome any suggestions on interesting / new topics.
- Hit me up [if you're not spamming me]!
